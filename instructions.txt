# Python Developer Technical Test

1.  Given the provided file 20000.txt – find the following using Python code:
      ✓  Count of instances of the word Nautilus
      ✓  Count of instances of the word Nemo
      ✓  The line number of the instance of word Nautilus that is closest to an instance of the word Nemo
          within the file. Nemo can appear before or after Nautilus and on a different line. Closest is defined
          by the smallest number of characters between the leading N on Nautilus and Nemo.


2.  A date can be formatted as DDMMYY such that 3rd June 2022 can be represented as '030622'. In this format:
      - YY is always the last two digits of the year.
      - DD and MM are always padded with a leading zero where required.
      - The formatted date is always 6 characters long.

      ✓   Using this format write Python code to find the count of palindromic date strings from 1st  January 1970
          to 31st December 2021. Palindromic means that the date string reads the same forwards and backwards. For
          example:
            - 1st January 2000 formats as '010100' and is NOT palindromic
            - 2nd November 2020 formats as '021120' and is palindromic


What we're looking for:
▪ Clean and understandable code.
▪ You should aim to get this test back to us within a day but there is no precise time limit.
